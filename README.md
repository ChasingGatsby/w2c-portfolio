# w2c-portfolio
## Description
This week we were tasked with desigin an online portfolio from scratch. The website would be complete once several factors were present, such as an about-me section, a list of projects, and contact information; a navigation bar to reach those sections; and project images that would link to said applications when clicked. In addition, the website also needed to be accessible and adjusted for various screen resolutions.

Since there was no starter code to work off of, this task was a bit daunting. In particular, the need to impose my own boundaries on the dimensions and properties of the intended application was difficult, particularly due to my inexperience. Having to keep track of elements while constantly adding new ones was definitely something I had to drill into myself as I worked, even more so once I had to start using flexbox to ensure everything fit onto the page the way that I wanted it to.

As a first "solo" project, I'm not too dissatisfied with the end product. It's definitely opened my eyes to where my logic has some gaps, especially in how modifying elements can affect the behavior of elements. Hopefully this can serve as a good stepping stone for developing my approach to development as I continue to expand my own knowledge base.
